    <h1>ONBOARDING</h1>
    <p>Onboarding is the phase you, as a new ALX learner, go through in between making the decision that you want to start this course and being a fully set up learner for this program, knowing exactly how to use the most the tools and resources needed for the program.</p>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <p>This is the phase explaining what the program is about. It should include key details about the program that give the learner enough information to understand the purpose and scope of the course.</p>
    <h3>PEER GROUPING</h3> 
    <p>Peer grouping is the social phase of the course, allowing learners to be subdivided into smaller groups to share and discuss topics that seem challenging. This is where learners can escape supervision from moderators and learn on their own. The influence of the peer group helps learners to understand more while they teach their peers.</p>
    <p>Peer learning also gives learners the chance to move out of their spaces and meet to socialize while "doing hard things" the ALX way!
        This is a group of learners having a group discussion.</p>
