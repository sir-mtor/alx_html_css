 FIGMA PROJECT README
 
 #Overview

Welcome to my Figma project! This README providesall information and instructions to understand and implement the design. i will follow these guidelines to ensure a seamless integration of the design into the development project.



#Fonts

The design utilizes two fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT. Ensure that these fonts are available on my computer to maintain the intended visual appearance.

#Values and Rounding

Some values in the design are in float. Feel free to round them as needed during the implementation process. This adjustment will help achieve a visually consistent and polished result.

Interactions

Responsive Design
The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less. Ensure that your implementation adheres to this responsive behavior for an optimal user experience across devices.

Hover/Active Effects
Links: When hovered or active, set the color to #FF6565 to provide a visual indication of interactivity.
css
Copy code
a:hover, a:active {
    color: #FF6565;
}
Buttons: Apply an opacity of 0.9 when buttons are hovered or active to create a subtle visual feedback.
css
Copy code
button:hover, button:active {
    opacity: 0.9;
}
Content Width

Ensure that the maximum width of the content is set to 1000px and centered in the page. This design choice enhances readability and creates a visually appealing layout.

css
Copy code
.content {
    max-width: 1000px;
    margin: 0 auto; /* Center the content */
}
